## An essential list for protestors

** This is an unordered list of suggestions. Once I have feedback on this, I will put out a poll to get rankings**  
** from those rankings I am thinking of multiple size handouts from the essential to the good ideas.**

Note: wait until well away from the protest to turn it on if you're concerned about anything. Otherwise, it could give law enforcement times for when you arrived & left.
