# Guides for Protests

This is intended to be a repository for technical instructions related to how protestors can protect themselves and fellow protestors from unwanted surveillance. It can not cover every option and every variant of each operating system or mobile device, but it will attempt to have basic information that can be followed at various levels and by both non-technical and technical individuals. The first thing will be a time of protest list that are the essential steps that should be taken. As this evolves I hope to add instructions for things you can do prior to a protest and things you should do after one. At this time none of the advice given related to your rights in dealing with law enforcement has been vetted by any lawyers, but they are my understanding as seen from various other resources. Please see the resources page.
